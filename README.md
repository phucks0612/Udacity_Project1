# Udacity_Project1

Data visualization to understand of coding during youth in order to success in tech field

## Motivation

A typical confusion about developers is that theyâ€™ve all been programming since youth. I want to see if it is true using data.

## Technology used

```
* [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) - The data set used
* [Python Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org)
* [Python Numpy library](https://numpy.org)
```

## Summary

- There is little to no gap between developers who program since your with those who break into the field
- The average time spent to learn before getting a professional job is increasing

## What's included

```
* source.ipynb - the main file in which all the calculation is done
```
